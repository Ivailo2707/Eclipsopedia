            <p>A solar eclipse is a captivating celestial event where the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, momentarily blocking the sun's light. This remarkable phenomenon occurs during a new moon when the three celestial bodies align perfectly.

                There are two primary types of solar eclipses: total and partial. During a total solar eclipse, the moon completely covers the sun, casting a shadow on the Earth and plunging the surrounding area into a brief darkness. This unique sight allows observers to witness the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the solar corona, which is typically hidden by the sun's intense brightness. In contrast, a partial solar eclipse occurs when only a portion of the sun is obscured by the moon, creating a crescent shape as the moon moves across the sun's surface. This type of eclipse is more common and can be observed from a wider geographical area.

                Solar eclipses are rare and often eagerly anticipated events that draw skywatchers, scientists, and enthusiasts from around the world. Proper eye protection, such as specialized eclipse glasses or solar viewers, is essential for safe viewing, as looking directly at the sun can cause permanent eye damage.</p>
